## Installation

This app is build using ReactJs as front-end framework and NodeJs with express for building APIs. It has login, signup, and profile view functionality.

I have used TailwindCss framework for rapidly building custom user interfaces.

This app requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
npm install
```
## Build the project

```sh
npm run build
```
Run this command to generate the static files for hosting purpose. Once the build is completed it will create a folder called ```build```

## Run server
```sh
npm run server
```

## Run client
```sh
npm run client
```

## Run server and client simultaneously
```sh
npm run dev
```
